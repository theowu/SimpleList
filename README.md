# SimpleList

<b>SimpleList</b> is an <b>iOS</b> application type toDoList or ckecklist. Learning from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/">Ray Wenderlich</a>'s tutorial, i wrote the code in <b>Swift</b> from scratch. The application lets you create SimpleLists which will include list items which indicate things to be done or already done with green checkmarks in front of them. You can also schedule a local notification for each item.
